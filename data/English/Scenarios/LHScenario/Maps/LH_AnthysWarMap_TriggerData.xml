                <BodyText>The voyage did not go easily.  For four long days the storms raged around you, and in the sudden flashes of lightning you could see the silhouetted forms of black birds in the sky, seemingly unaffected by the wind and rain.  On the second night a winged creature attacked, grabbed crewmen and threw them into sea.  It was an elemental of some sort, but dark and twisted, and you recognized the familiar touch of Ceresa's power.

				The sea finally cast you against the rocks and you dragged the few men that survived out of the wreckage.  From here you will need to establish a base and warn Queen Procipinee of the threat in the east.</BodyText>

But having examined several of these beasts, I have concluded that they are kin to the black widow spider. Their great size (the span from leg tip to opposite leg tip has been measured in some cases at ten feet), their foul disposition (they will attack anything that moves in their field of vision), and above all, their taste for animal flesh, must be attributed to necromancy of the most foul and cruel sort. These beasts are to be avoided, yes, but pitied as well.

                <BodyText>In the time of the dragons, there lived a girl named Olanna. She was daughter to a great Nimer chieftain, and wise as she was beautiful. But because she was a woman, when her father died, she could not become chief. This angered her and she fled into the White Mountains, taking shelter in the catacombs deep beneath those peaks.
				
				One day a Garrote came to her cavern. This beast is a maneater, but was captivated by Olanna's beauty. They lay together in the darkness, and made a child, the first ogre. They had a dozen more, and Olanna taught each of her children to hate man, and to live in solitude. These lessons were passed down through each generation.</BodyText>

                <BodyText>Of these creatures, Lord Argynn wrote 'they have the strength of a hundred men, and the temper of a hundred scorned maidens.' This is exaggeration, but there is truth in it, for the garrote is strong enough to carry a horsecart, and quick indeed to anger. Many hunt these animals for sport, or for their horns and pelts, but I consider these acts cruelty of the worst sort. 
				
				I first had cause to observe this creature in the time of my youth, when a hunting party returned to our village from the north, bearing two dozen aribu carcasses, and in a great wooden cage, a beast they called 'snow ogre.' Out of cruelty and spite, they subjected this</BodyText>

                <BodyText>creature to various tortures. As I observed these acts, and the garrote's reactions, I became convinced of its intelligence, and possessed of a desire to help it escape.
				
				Sadly, I found no way to free the creature but one. I obtained from the apothecary a quantity of poison, and sprinkled it in the garrote's food. Thus ended its torment - an act I pray the Five forgive me for.</BodyText>

When Sirdir was cast down, many of these creatures were said to have passed from the world as well. Those that remain congregate near their sacred places of old, near the shards whose essence contains the same power they draw upon.
